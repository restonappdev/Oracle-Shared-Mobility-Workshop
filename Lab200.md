# Lab 200: Install and Instantiate Chaincodes (Smart Contracts)
## Introduction
Chaincodes are programs that implement a prescribed interface for your blockchain network. They typically handle business logic for members of the network, taking on the role of smart contracts. These are the two chaincodes we are going to be installing today:

- vehicleReg – A chaincode for registering vehicles, putting them into or taking them out of service, and tracking their current location.
- tripLogger – A chaincode for recording the trips taken by a vehicle.


## Objectives
- Learn how to install chaincodes to peers
- Learn how to instantiate chaincodes onto channels
- Export nodes to ensure all participants are connected

## Required Artifacts
- Completed Lab 100 and have a Blockchain network with a Founder (CityOfTownship) and two Participants (RiderCo & ScooterCo).
- Have the chaincode files (tripLogger.go.zip and vehicleReg.go.zip) from the artifacts repository.

---
- We will start at the service console for the CityOfTownship organization. (If you need to see how to access the consoles for your organizations, see Lab 100.) You will open the Chaincodes tab and click the Install Chaincode button.

### Step 1: Install Chaincodes on the Founder
- The modal that appears will have default values for the chaincode. We will be overwriting all of these.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_79.png)

- We will start with installing the tripLogger chaincode. The fields should contain the following:

-   a). Chaincode Name – The name of the chaincode. We will be using “tripLogger” in this case.
-   b). Version – The version of the chaincode. We will be using “v1”. This field does not need to contain a number for the version, but we recommend it as this will make things easier when updating the chaincode later.
-   c). Target Peers – The peers where you will be installing the chaincode. Select both of the peers for the organization.
-   d). Chaincode Source – Select Local as you will be uploading the file from your computer.

- You will then click the link to Upload a chaincode file.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_80.png)

- Select the tripLogger.go.zip file.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_81.png)

- Once you have uploaded the file, click the Install button.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_82.png)

- You will then need to follow the same steps for the vehicleReg chaincode.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_83.png)
![](./images/200/Docker_Image_84.png)

- Now that the chaincodes are installed, but they are not yet instantiated. A chaincode needs to be instantiated for it to be available on a channel. On the Chaincodes tab, click the disclosure triangle next to the tripLogger chaincode.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_85.png)

- Make sure the chaincode is showing as being installed on two peers and instantiated on zero channels.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_86.png)

### Step 2: Install Chaincodes on the Participants

- We will now switch to the ScooterCo organization’s console, and go through the same installation steps. It is important that you use the exact same name and version number here as you used on CityOfTownship.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_87.png)
![](./images/200/Docker_Image_88.png)
![](./images/200/Docker_Image_89.png)

- Now switch to the RiderCo organization’s console, and complete the same installation steps. Once again, the chaincode name and version number should be the same as those used with CityOfTownship.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_90.png)
![](./images/200/Docker_Image_91.png)

### Step 3: Instantiate Chaincodes on Both Channels

- We can now return to the CityOfTownship service console. From the Chaincodes tab, click on the tripLogger link (the link that is the name of the chaincode, rather than the disclosure triangle).

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_92.png)

- You will be brought to the tripLogger chaincode page, showing its versions. Click the menu icon on the right of the listing for v1.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_93.png)

- Click the option to Instantiate the chaincode.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_94.png)

- On the modal that appears, you will need to enter the following:

-   a). Channel – The channel where you are instantiating the chaincode. We will start with riderco.channel.
-   b). Peers – The peers that will access this chaincode on this channel. Select both peers for the organization.
-   c). For the Endorsement Policy – Click the Add Identity button twice for the two members of the channel that will be using this chaincode. Select the RiderCo organization and the CityOfTownship organization, and make sure that they have the Member role.
-   d). Policy Expression Mode – Select Basic here.
-   e). For the endorsement we will want it to be Signed By 2 organizations, meaning that both members in the channel will have to sign a transaction before it is written to the ledger.

- The modal should look like this as you click the Instantiate button.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_95.png)

- Once you have instantiated the chaincode on the riderco.channel, we will do the same thing for the chaincode on the scooterco.channel, making sure that only ScooterCo and CityOfTownship organizations are members.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_96.png)

- Once you have completed the instantiation steps for both channels, the tripLogger chaincode page should look like this.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_97.png)

- We will now go to the vehicleReg chaincode page, and complete the same instantiation steps for both channels.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_98.png)
![](./images/200/Docker_Image_99.png)

### Step 4: Export Participant Nodes to the Founder
- We will now switch to the RiderCo organization’s console. Fortunately, when a chaincode is instantiated on a channel that instantiation happens for all organizations on the channel, so we do not need to instantiate the chaincode again. From the Chaincodes tab on the RiderCo console, click the disclosure triangle next to tripLogger to see this in effect.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_100.png)

- As you can see, the chaincode is instantiated on our channel. Now, we will need to export the nodes one more time, so that the CityOfTownship will know that the RiderCo nodes have the chaincodes installed on them. Click the Nodes tab.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_101.png)

- On the Nodes tab, click the Export/Import button, and select the Export option.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_102.png)

- On the modal that appears, select both of the peers and then click the Export button. Be sure to note the name of the file that is downloaded.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_103.png)

- We will now need to export the nodes for the ScooterCo organization. Go to the ScooterCo service console’s Nodes tab. From there, click the Export/Import button and select the Export option.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_104.png)

- On the modal that appears, select both of the peers and then click the Export button. Be sure to note the name of the file that is downloaded.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_105.png)

- Now return to the CityOfTownship service console and go to its Nodes tab. From there, click the Export/Import button and select the Import option.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_106.png)

- On the modal that appears, click the link to Upload remote nodes configurations and select the file for the exported RiderCo nodes. Then click the + button, click the new Upload remote nodes configurations link, and select the file for the exported ScooterCo nodes.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_107.png)
![](./images/200/Docker_Image_108.png)

- Finally, click the Import button.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_109.png)

- You will now have the updated remote peers appearing in the Nodes list for the CityOfTownship. We will now export the CityOfTownship’s nodes for the other organizations. Click the Export/Import button.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_110.png)

### Step 5: Export Founder Nodes to the Participants
- Now select the Export option.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_112.png)

- On the modal that appears, select both of the CityOfTownship’s peers, and click the Export button. Take note of the name of the file and where on your computer it was downloaded.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_111.png)

- We will now switch to the service console for the ScooterCo organization. On its Nodes tab, click the Export/Import button and select the Import option.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_113.png)

- On the modal that appears, click the Upload remote nodes configuration link.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_114.png)

- Select the file containing the CityOfTownship’s exported peers.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_115.png)

- Then click the Import button.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_116.png)

- You will now see the remote peers on the ScooterCo’s peer list.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_117.png)

- We will now complete the same steps to import the CityOfTownship’s peers to the RiderCo organization.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_118.png)

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_119.png)

### Step 6: Configure the Founder's Rest Proxy

- Now that you have installed and instantiated the chaincodes, and all organizations have the node information has been shared between organizations, there is one final step to allow us to interact with our chaincodes. We will need to make the chaincodes available on the REST proxy for our organizations.

- We will begin at the CityOfTownship service console. In the Nodes tab, click the menu icon next to the REST Proxy peer, and select the Edit option.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_120.png)

- Since the CityOfTownship is using both chaincodes on both channels, we will need to set four configuration options. On the configuration modal, click the + button until there are four separate rows.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_121.png)

- The first two rows will be the configuration for both chaincodes on riderco.channel. Set one line to tripLogger:v1 and the other to vehicleReg:v1. Then select both of the RiderCo and CityOfTownship peers as endorsers for both chaincodes.

- The second two rows will be the configuration for both chaincodes on scooterco.channel. Set one row to tripLogger:v1 and the other to vehicleReg:v1. Then select both of the ScooterCo and CityOfTownship peers as endorsers for both chaincodes.

- When you are done, the configuration modal should look like this. If it does, click the Submit button.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_122.png)

- The REST Proxy node has now been configured, but that configuration is not yet active. We will need to restart the peer to activate the configuration.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_123.png)

- At the top of your Nodes list, you should see a restart icon. Click that icon and the REST Proxy node will be restarted.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_125.png)

### Step 7: Configure the Participants' Rest Proxies
- We will now switch to the service console for RiderCo to configure its REST Proxy. In the Nodes tab, click the menu icon next to the REST Proxy peer, and select the Edit option.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_126.png)

- Since RiderCo is using both chaincodes on only one channel, we will need to set two configuration options. On the configuration modal, click the + button until there are two rows.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_127.png)

- The two rows will be the configuration for both chaincodes on riderco.channel. Set one line to tripLogger:v1 and the other to vehicleReg:v1. Then select both of the RiderCo and CityOfTownship peers as endorsers for both chaincodes.

- When you are done, the configuration modal should look like this. If it does, click the Submit button.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_128.png)

- Once again, the REST Proxy node has now been configured, but that configuration is not yet active. We will need to restart the peer to activate the configuration. Click the restart icon at the top of the node list and the REST Proxy node will be restarted.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_129.png)

- Finally, we will need to configure the REST Proxy for the ScooterCo organization. Change to the ScooterCo organization’s service console and follow the same configuration steps.

![](./images/200/Docker_Image_130.png)
![](./images/200/Docker_Image_131.png)
![](./images/200/Docker_Image_132.png)
![](./images/200/Docker_Image_133.png)

- Congratulations! You have completed this lab. The chaincodes are now active and you can use them to store data to the blockchain and read that data.

- We have created a website that will allow you to interact with the chaincodes as though you were the CityOfTownship, RiderCo, or ScooterCo. Go to https://oowblockchain.tech and enter the required information. Try registering vehicles, putting them in service, and taking trips. You will be able to see that information updated on the CityOfTownship dashboard immediately.
