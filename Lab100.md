# Lab 100: Creating a Blockchain Network (Docker Version)
## Introduction
This lab will cover setting up the blockchain network. We will create a founder and two participant organizations, then tie them together with channels.

## Objectives
- Learn how to set up a founder organization
- Learn how to set up a participant organization
- Register the participants by importing orderer settings and exporting certificates
- Create two channels to ensure privacy between the founder and individual participants

## Required Artifacts
-	The IP address for a virtual machine running the Oracle Blockchain Application.
-	The username and password to access that virtual machine.

---
### Step 0: Log in to the Virtual Machine
- Open the URL for the virtual machine. You will see a login page. Enter your username and password.

- When you have successfully logged in, you will then see the network provisioning page of the Blockchain Application.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_00.png)

### Step 1: Create Your Blockchain Network

- In the right-hand column on that page, select **Create Block Chain Network**. In the **Organization** section, the fields should contain the following:

  * **Name** – The name for the founder organization. If this example, we use **CityOfTownship**

  * **Domain** – A theoretical domain name for the organization. We use **township.org**.

  * **Number of Peers** – The number of peers in the network. You will need at least 1, we use **2**.

  * **Host Address** – The address that will be used to access the peers, nodes, and console for this network. Since this is being created directly on your virtual machine, you will need to enter the IP address for your virtual machine (without any port information).

  * **REST Proxy Port** – The port at your host address that will be used for the REST proxy (where the rest of the internet can interact with your network and its chaincodes). This should be a number between 3000 and 65000. We used **4567**.

  * **Console Port** – The port at your host address that you will use to access the network console page. This will also needs to a number between 3000 and 65000, and cannot be the same number as the REST Proxy Port. We used **7654**.

  * **Peer Start Port** – The lower port number that can be used for network peers. This is automatically filled with the number **10000** and can remain that way.

  * **Peer End Port** – The highest port number that can be used for network peers. This is automatically filled with the number **65535**, and can remain that way.

  * **Orderer Port** – The port that will be used for the network orderer node. The orderer is a node running the communication service that implements a delivery guarantee. You can read more on orderer nodes at https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.3/arch-deep-dive.html. This will also needs to a number between 3000 and 65000, and cannot be the same number as any other provided port. We used **3001**.

  * **Ordered Type** – The type of ordered node that will be created. Select the **Solo** option, as this is a Founder-Participant network.

When you are done entering your information, the provisioning page should look like this:

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_1.png)

- Click **Apply**. Since you are using an IP for your host address, you will get a warning message asking you to confirm this option. Click **Okay**, as we will not need to worry about dynamic IP addresses.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_2.png)

- You will then see the newly-created organization added to the organization list on the left-hand column, and you will be asked to click to manage the network. Clicking that link will open the console for that network.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_3.png)

- You can open in a new browser tab.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_4.png)

### Step 2: Create the Participant ScooterCo
- Before we do anything on this console, we will need to do a few more things on the provisioning page first. If at any point you accidentally close the tab for this console, you can always re-open it by clicking the organization name on the provisioning page.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_5.png)

- On the provisioning page, you will now select the option to **Create a Block Chain Organization**.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_6.png)

- We will be creating the *ScooterCo* organization. There are fewer options when creating an organization that is not also a network founder, but all of the same information applies. Also, since we will be operating all organizations on the same host, the REST Proxy Port and Console Port should not be any of the same ports used by your founder network. When you have filled out all the fields, it should look like this:

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_7.png)

- You will receive another warning about using an IP address, and can once again click **Okay**.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_8.png)

- You will be presented with a link to the console for this organization. You can also open this in another tab.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_9.png)

- You will now see the *ScooterCo* organization in your organization list. We will now create the final organization. Select Create Block Chain Organization.

### Step 3: Create the Participant RiderCo

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_10.png)

- We will now be creating the *RiderCo* organization. The requirements for the information will be the same as those for ScooterCo.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_12.png)

- When the information is entered and you click **Apply**, the you will receive the final warning about using an IP address for the Host Address.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_13.png)

- Now that this final organization has been created, you can click the link to open the BCS console for the RiderCo organization. If you do not have the BCS consoles open for the ScooterCo and CityOfTownship organizations, you should open them now in separate tabs.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_14.png)

### Step 4: Export the Orderer Settings from the Founder

If this were a real deployment, each of the organizations would be utilizing the Oracle Blockchain Application on their own networks, and each would only have access to their own organization’s console. You may want to imagine, as you move between each of the consoles, that you are taking on the role of that specific organization’s blockchain administrator.

- The first console we need to access is for our network founder, **CityOfTownship**.

- NOTE: Since all of the consoles look very similar, you can always check the upper-right corner of the console to see the name of the organization whose console you are using.

- From the CityOfTownship console, open the **Network** tab.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_15.png)

- You will see the Network Summary and the list of organizations that are currently part of the network. Currently, on the CityOfTownship itself is part of its network. To add the additional organizations, we will need to click the **Menu icon** on the right of the CityOfTownship listing.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_16.png)

- A menu will appear and you will need to select the option to **Download Orderer Settings**.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_17.png)

- A file containing the orderer settings for the CityOfTownship network will be downloaded to your computer. *Be sure to note where the file was saved, as we will need it soon*.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_18.png)

### Step 5: Import the Orderer Settings to Participant ScooterCo

- Now we will need to access the service console for the **ScooterCo** organization. If you do not already have this console page open, you can access it from the provisioning page.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_19.png)

- Once you are at the ScooterCo service console, you will need to click the **Network** tab.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_20.png)

- In the Network tab, click the button labeled **Import Orderer Settings**.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_21.png)

- On the modal that appears, click the link to **Upload Orderer Settings**.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_22.png)

- Select the orderer settings file that was downloaded previously and click **Submit**. If this were a production network being created, this file would have been sent from the CityOfTownship to ScooterCo once they reached an agreement on joining the network.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_23.png)

### Step 6: Import the Orderer Settings to Participant RiderCo

- Now we will need to access the service console for the **RiderCo** organization. If you do not already have this console page open, you can access it from the provisioning page.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_24.png)

- Once you are at the RiderCo service console, you will need to click the **Network** tab. These steps will be the same as those undertaken with ScooterCo.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_25.png)

- In the Network tab, click the button labeled **Import Orderer Settings**.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_26.png)

- On the modal that appears, click the link to **Upload Orderer Settings**.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_27.png)

- Select the orderer settings file that was downloaded previously and click **Submit**.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_28.png)

### Step 7: Export the Participant Certificates to the Founder

- Now that you have imported the orderer settings, we will need to export the particpant certificates for RiderCo. Click the **RiderCo** name in the upper-right corner of the console, and then click **Export Certificates**.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_29.png)

- A file named *certs.json* will download. Be sure to note where it was saved on your computer.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_30.png)

- Now we will need to turn to the **ScooterCo** console and complete the same steps for exporting certificates.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_31.png)

- Once again, be sure to note where the *certs.json* file was saved (depending on your operating system and browser, the *certs.json* file from ScooterCo may have a name like *certs (1).json*).

### Step 8: Import the Organization Certificates to the Founder

- We will now return to the console for the **CityOfTownship**. On its **Network** tab, click the button to **Add Organizations**.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_42.png)

- On the modal that appears, click the link to **Upload Organization Certificates**.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_43.png)

- Select the **certs.json** file from the *RiderCo* organization.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_44.png)

- Once you see the *certs.json* file on the list of organizations, click the **+** button and you will see an option to upload another organization’s certificate. Click that link and select the *certs(1).json* file for ScooterCo. Once you have added that item, click the **Add All** button.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_45.png)

- You should now see *RiderCo* and *ScooterCo* in the list of organizations within your network. They will each have the role of **Participant** while *CityOfTownship* has the role of **Founder**.

### Step 9: Create the Channels

Now, we will create the individual channels for our network. Channels allow information on the blockchain network to be shared with only specific members in the network.

- Click the **Channels** tab for the CityOfTownship console.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_46.png)

- On the Channels tab, click the **Create Channel** button.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_47.png)

- We will create the channel for *RiderCo* first. You will need to enter the Channel Name, select the organizations that will take part in the channel, decide on their access level, and choose the peers within your organization that will join this channel.

- In this case, since this channel is to be the private channel between *RiderCo* and *CityOfTownship*, we will call it **riderco.channel**. We will select **RiderCo** and **CityOfTownship** as members, and make sure the both have **ReaderWriter** access.
  * NOTE: Make sure to only select **RiderCo** and **CityOfTownship**. If you add ScooterCo to this channel, it will no longer be private between those two members.

- Now, add both available peers to the channel. The modal for creating the channel should look like this as you click the **Submit** button.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_48.png)

- Complete the same steps for **ScooterCo**, naming its channel **scooterco.channel** and making sure that only *ScooterCo* and *CityOfTownship* are members of the group. Once you have created the second channel, your Channels page should look like this.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_49.png)

### Step 10: Join the Participant Peers to the Channels

- Now, we need to return to the console for **RiderCo** so that we can join its peers to **riderco.channel**. Open the **Nodes** tab on the RiderCo console, and click on **peer0**.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_50.png)

- You will see the dashboard for that peer, showing its current status. Click on the **Joined Channels** link.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_51.png)

- On the Joined Channels page, click the **Join Channel** button.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_52.png)

- On the modal that appears, enter **riderco.channel** and then click the **Join** button.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_53.png)

- Now return to the main **Nodes** tab, and click on **peer1**.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_54.png)

- On the dashboard for peer1, click on the **Joined Channels** link.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_55.png)

- Then click on the **Join Channel** button.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_56.png)

- Enter **riderco.channel** and click the **Join** button.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_57.png)

- We will now follow the same steps for the **ScooterCo** organization, for **scooterco.channel**. Go to that console and its **Nodes** tab.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_58.png)

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_59.png)

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_60.png)

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_61.png)

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_62.png)

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_63.png)

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_64.png)

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_65.png)

### Step 11: Export the Participants to the Founder

- Returning to the main **Nodes** tab for **ScooterCo**, click the **Export/Import** button and select the **Export** option.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_66.png)

- Select both of the peers for the organization and click the **Export** button. *Take note of where the node export file was downloaded and what it was named.*

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_67.png)

- We will now switch to the **RiderCo** organization’s console, go to the **Nodes** tab, click the **Export/Import** button, and select the **Export** option.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_68.png)

- Once again, select both of the peers for this organization and click the **Export** button. *Also take note of where this new node export file was downloaded and what it was named.*

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_69.png)

- With both of the exported node files ready, switch to the **CityOfTownship** console. On that console, go to the **Nodes** tab, click the **Export/Import** button, and select **Import**.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_70.png)

- On the modal that appears, click the link to **Upload remote nodes configuration**.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_71.png)

- Select the most recent node export file for the **RiderCo** organization.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_72.png)

- Click the **+** button and then click the new link to **Upload remote nodes configuration**.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_73.png)

- This time, select the most recent node export file for the **ScooterCo** organization. Once you have selected that file, click the **Import** button.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_74.png)

- You should now see each of the *RiderCo* and *ScooterCo* peers listed as remote peers. Now click on the **Graph icon**.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_76.png)

- Clicking the graph icon will show you the network topology for your peers and channels. It should look something like this.

![](./images/100/Docker_Image_77.png)

Congratulations! You have completed this lab. When you are ready, go to [Lab 200](Lab200.md) and we will learn about installing chaincodes (smart contracts).
